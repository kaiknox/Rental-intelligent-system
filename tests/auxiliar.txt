Test 1: Family young, workers + one student

Checks client classification to Family/No_Elderly.
Exercises work-place and study-place distance calculation with multiple coordinates.
Verifies room-density categorization with 3 people vs listed rooms.
Runs basic property evaluation and classification.
Test 2: Young couple, no car/pets, 2 workers downtown

Checks couple handling without explicit “is-couple” prompt (still classifies via ages/np).
Focuses on work-place distance around urban core/metro.
Evaluates constraints related to budget vs price (non-strict).
Ensures no student distances are computed.
Test 3: Family with minors, workers and students

Forces Family classification due to minors.
Exercises both distance rules with multiple work and study locations.
Validates desired_features enrichment for families (garden/park/safe-area).
Checks room-density against larger group and mixed preferences.
Test 4: Student group of 3, no workers

Classifies as Student_Group (students yes, works no, no elderly/minors).
Stresses study-place distances with three campuses.
Validates student-oriented desired_features (education/public-transport/internet/nightlife).
Ensures budget impacts evaluation for lower budgets.
Test 5: Elderly individual

Classifies as Elderly (np=1, age ≥ 65).
Skips work/study distances.
Validates elderly-oriented desired_features (elevator/quiet/single-floor/healthcare).
Checks evaluation under moderate budget and accessibility-oriented properties.

Test 6: Strict low budget, 2 people, no work/study

Focus: Budget constraints with budget_is_strict=yes.
Ensures properties over max_budget are rejected and no distance rules run.
Good baseline for minimal logistics.
Test 7: Pets + car; 3 people; workers only

Focus: Desired features pets-allowed and parking.
Exercises work distances from residential/metro areas.
Checks non-strict budget tolerance and family-like preferences.
Test 8: Elderly couple; no work/study

Focus: Elderly classification and accessibility preferences (elevator, quiet, single-floor, healthcare).
Skips logistics; evaluates suitability of properties for mobility/access.
Validates room-density for 2 people vs listed rooms.
Test 9: Student group with multiple campuses

Focus: calculate-study-distances with several campus coordinates.
Classifies as Student_Group; verifies student-oriented features (education, public-transport, nightlife).
Budget impact on lower shared budgets.
Test 10: Room-density extreme; 5 people, few rooms

Focus: calculate-room-density categorization under capacity shortage.
With 5 people and limited rooms, expects saturated unless a property has enough doubles/singles.
Also tests work-place distance with a single work location.
